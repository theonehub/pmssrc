# Authentication Fix for Salary Components Creation

## Problem
The original script was failing with 401 "Not authenticated" errors because the salary components API requires JWT authentication.

## Solution
Created `create_salary_components_with_auth.py` which:

1. **Automatically generates JWT tokens** using the same secret and algorithm as the API server
2. **Tests authentication** before attempting to create components
3. **Handles authentication errors** gracefully
4. **Provides better error reporting** and status tracking

## Key Features

### üîê Automatic Authentication
- Generates JWT tokens with proper claims (employee_id, role, permissions)
- Uses the same JWT_SECRET and JWT_ALGORITHM as the API server
- Token expires in 24 hours (configurable)

### üß™ Authentication Testing
- Tests authentication before creating components
- Provides clear feedback on authentication status
- Fails fast if authentication doesn't work

### üìä Enhanced Reporting
- Tracks success, failed, and skipped components
- Identifies components that already exist
- Provides detailed error logging

### üîß Error Handling
- Handles 401 (authentication), 409 (conflict), and other HTTP errors
- Provides actionable error messages
- Continues processing even if some components fail

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install python-jose requests

# Run the script
python create_salary_components_with_auth.py
```

### Environment Variables (Optional)
```bash
export JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key-change-in-production"
export JWT_ALGORITHM="HS256"
```

## Components Created (27 Total)

- **EARNING (18)**: Basic salary + all fully taxable allowances + partially exempt allowances + special allowances
- **DEDUCTION (4)**: PF, ESI, Professional Tax, Income Tax
- **REIMBURSEMENT (3)**: Fuel, Medical, Travel reimbursements

## Verification
After running the script, use:
```bash
python verify_components.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **python-jose not installed**: `pip install python-jose`
2. **API server not running**: Start the salary components service on port 8001
3. **JWT secret mismatch**: Ensure JWT_SECRET matches between script and API server

### Success Indicators
- ‚úÖ Authentication token generated successfully
- ‚úÖ Authentication successful
- ‚úÖ Components created successfully

The script now handles authentication automatically and should work without any manual token configuration!
