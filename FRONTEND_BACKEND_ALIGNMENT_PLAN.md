# Frontend-Backend Alignment Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to align frontend taxation types directly with backend DTOs, eliminating the need for field mapping utilities. Since the project is not yet deployed, we can make direct changes without backward compatibility concerns.

## Current State Analysis

### Backend DTOs (Target Structure)
The backend expects the following structure in `CreateTaxationRecordRequest`:

```python
# backend/app/application/dto/taxation/create_taxation_record_request.py
@dataclass
class CreateTaxationRecordRequest:
    employee_id: str
    financial_year: str
    age: int  # ← was emp_age in frontend
    salary_income: SalaryIncomeDTO
    other_income: OtherIncomeDTO
    capital_gains_income: CapitalGainsDTO
    house_property_income: HousePropertyIncomeDTO
    tax_deductions: TaxDeductionsDTO
    retirement_benefits: RetirementBenefitsDTO
    perquisites: PerquisitesDTO
```

### Frontend Types (Current State)
The frontend currently uses different field names and structures:

```typescript
// frontend/src/shared/types/taxation.ts (current)
interface TaxationData {
  employee_id: string;
  financial_year: string;
  emp_age: number;  // ← should be age
  salary: SalaryComponents;  // ← should be salary_income
  // ... other mismatched fields
}
```

## Alignment Strategy

### 1. Direct Field Mapping
Instead of using transformation utilities, we'll update frontend types to match backend exactly:

#### Critical Field Renames:
- `emp_age` → `age`
- `salary` → `salary_income`
- `other_sources` → `other_income`
- `capital_gains` → `capital_gains_income`
- `house_property` → `house_property_income`

#### Salary Component Field Renames:
- `basic` → `basic_salary`
- `hra` → `hra_received`
- `hra_city` → `hra_city_type`
- `transport_allowance` → `conveyance_allowance`
- `fixed_medical_allowance` → `medical_allowance`
- `any_other_allowance` → `other_allowances`

### 2. Structural Changes

#### From Flat to Nested Deductions:
```typescript
// OLD (flat structure)
interface TaxDeductions {
  section_80c_lic: number;
  section_80c_epf: number;
  section_80d_hisf: number;
}

// NEW (nested structure matching backend)
interface TaxDeductionsData {
  section_80c: number;
  section_80d: number;
  section_80g: number;
  section_80e: number;
  section_80tta: number;
  life_insurance_premium: number;
  provident_fund: number;
  elss_investment: number;
  home_loan_principal: number;
  tuition_fees: number;
  nsc_investment: number;
  other_deductions: number;
}
```

#### Grouped Retirement Benefits:
```typescript
// OLD (separate fields)
interface RetirementData {
  gratuity_received: number;
  leave_encashment: number;
  pension_income: number;
}

// NEW (grouped structure)
interface RetirementBenefitsData {
  gratuity: number;
  leave_encashment: number;
  pension: number;
  commutation: number;
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Type Definitions
1. Create new backend-aligned types in `taxation-aligned.ts`
2. Update main `taxation.ts` to export aligned types
3. Ensure all nested structures match backend DTOs exactly

### Phase 2: Component Updates
1. Update form components to use new field names
2. Update validation schemas
3. Update default values and initial state
4. Update any computed properties or derived state

### Phase 3: API Integration
1. Update service functions to use new types
2. Remove any transformation logic
3. Update error handling to use new field names
4. Test API calls with new structure

### Phase 4: State Management
1. Update Redux/Context state shapes
2. Update action creators and reducers
3. Update selectors to use new field names
4. Update any middleware or side effects

### Phase 5: Testing
1. Update unit tests with new field names
2. Update integration tests
3. Update end-to-end tests
4. Verify API compatibility

## Benefits

### 1. Simplified Architecture
- No mapping utilities needed
- Direct API compatibility
- Reduced code complexity
- Better maintainability

### 2. Performance Improvements
- No runtime transformation overhead
- Reduced bundle size
- Faster form submissions
- Better memory usage

### 3. Developer Experience
- Consistent naming across frontend and backend
- Better TypeScript support
- Clearer error messages
- Easier debugging

### 4. Type Safety
- Full TypeScript type checking
- Compile-time error detection
- Better IDE support
- Reduced runtime errors

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Comprehensive Testing
- Unit tests for all updated components
- Integration tests for API calls
- End-to-end tests for complete flows
- Manual testing of all forms

### 2. Gradual Rollout
- Update types first
- Update components one by one
- Test each change thoroughly
- Monitor for any issues

### 3. Documentation
- Update component documentation
- Update API documentation
- Create migration guides
- Document any breaking changes
