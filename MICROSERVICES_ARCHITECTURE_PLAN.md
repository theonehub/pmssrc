## Executive Summary

This document outlines the migration plan from the current monolithic Personnel Management System (PMS) to a microservices architecture using Docker containers and an API gateway. The proposed architecture will improve scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility while maintaining system functionality and performance.

### Key Benefits
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use optimal technology stacks
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Scale individual services based on demand
- **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can own and develop services independently
- **Fault Isolation**: Issues in one service don't affect the entire system
- **Multi-tenancy Support**: Enhanced support for organization-specific configurations

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Architecture
The current system is a monolithic application with clear module boundaries:

```
Backend Modules:
├── User Management
├── Organization Management
├── Employee Management
├── Attendance Tracking
├── Leave Management (Employee Leave, Company Leave, Public Holiday)
├── Payroll Processing
├── Reimbursement Management
├── Taxation
├── Project Attributes
└── Reporting

Frontend:
└── React Application with modular components
```

### Current Strengths
- Well-defined module boundaries
- Consistent architecture patterns
- Comprehensive functionality
- Established development practices

### Current Limitations
- Monolithic deployment
- Single point of failure
- Scaling challenges
- Technology lock-in
- Complex testing and deployment processes

    end
```

### Architecture Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one business domain
- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data
- **API-First Design**: Well-defined service interfaces
- **Stateless Services**: Services don't maintain session state
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Asynchronous messaging for loose coupling

## Docker Architecture

### Container Strategy
Each microservice will be containerized with:
- Dedicated Docker container
- Isolated environment
- Configurable resource limits
- Health check endpoints

### Docker Compose Structure
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  # API Gateway
  api-gateway:
    image: kong:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
      - "8001:8001"
    environment:
      KONG_DATABASE: "off"
      KONG_DECLARATIVE_CONFIG: /kong/declarative/kong.yml
    volumes:
      - ./kong:/kong/declarative

  # User Service
  user-service:
    build: ./services/user-service
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@user-db:5432/userdb
    depends_on:
      - user-db
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8001/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3

  user-db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: userdb
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - user_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  # Leave Service
  leave-service:
    build: ./services/leave-service
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://leave:password@leave-db:5432/leavedb
    depends_on:
      - leave-db

  leave-db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: leavedb
      POSTGRES_USER: leave
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - leave_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  # Add other services...

  # Shared Infrastructure
  redis:
    image: redis:6-alpine
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data

  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:3-management
    environment:
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: admin
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: password

volumes:
  user_data:
  leave_data:
  redis_data:
```

### Kubernetes Migration Path
For production scaling, consider Kubernetes deployment:
```yaml
# Example Kubernetes deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: user-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: user-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: user-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: user-service
        image: pms/user-service:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8001
        env:
        - name: DATABASE_URL
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: user-db-secret
              key: url
```
