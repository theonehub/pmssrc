## 1. PERQUISITES.PY FIXES

### 1.1 CRITICAL: Car Perquisite Calculation
**Issue**: Car perquisite rates were inverted - higher capacity cars got lower rates.
**Fix Applied**:
- **Higher capacity cars (>1.6L)**: Now get HIGHER rates as per IT rules
- **Mixed use with expenses reimbursed**: Higher capacity: Rs. 2,400, Lower: Rs. 1,800
- **Mixed use without expenses reimbursed**: Higher capacity: Rs. 900, Lower: Rs. 600
- **Personal use**: Full cost is taxable
- **Business use**: Not taxable

### 1.2 CRITICAL: Gift Vouchers Calculation
**Issue**: Was returning full amount instead of excess above Rs. 5,000.
**Fix Applied**:
```python
# BEFORE (Wrong)
if self.gift_vouchers_amount_paid_by_employer <= 5000:
    return 0
else:
    return self.gift_vouchers_amount_paid_by_employer  # Wrong: returns full amount

# AFTER (Fixed)
if self.gift_vouchers_amount_paid_by_employer <= 5000:
    return 0
else:
    return self.gift_vouchers_amount_paid_by_employer - 5000  # Correct: only excess
```

### 1.3 CRITICAL: Medical Reimbursement - Overseas Treatment
**Issue**: Overseas treatment calculation was incorrect.
**Fix Applied**:
- **Travel allowance**: Taxable only if gross salary > Rs. 2 lakh
- **Medical expenses**: Only amount beyond RBI limit is taxable
- **Proper separation**: Travel and medical components calculated separately

### 1.4 CRITICAL: LTA Calculation Logic
**Issue**: LTA exemption logic was incomplete and incorrect.
**Fix Applied**:
- **2-journey rule**: Properly implemented 2 journeys in 4-year block
- **Mode-based limits**: Railway (AC First Class), Air (Economy), Public transport
- **Taxable amount**: Correctly calculated as excess of claimed over eligible

### 1.5 CRITICAL: Interest-Free Loan Calculation
**Issue**: Complex calculation returning wrong annual value.
**Fix Applied**:
- **Simple calculation**: Principal × (Rate Difference / 100)
- **Exemptions**: Medical loans and loans ≤ Rs. 20,000 exempt
- **Proration**: Proper monthly proration when applicable

### 1.6 Added Missing Medical Reimbursement
**Issue**: Medical reimbursement was missing from total perquisites calculation.
**Fix Applied**: Added medical reimbursement to `total_taxable_income_per_slab` method.

## 2. SALARY.PY FIXES

### 2.1 CRITICAL: to_dict Method Decorator
**Issue**: Using `@classmethod` instead of instance method.
**Fix Applied**:
```python
# BEFORE (Wrong)
@classmethod
def to_dict(cls) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {"basic": cls.basic, ...}  # cls cannot access instance data

# AFTER (Fixed)
def to_dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {"basic": self.basic, ...}  # self correctly accesses instance data
```

### 2.2 CRITICAL: Perquisites Double Calculation
**Issue**: Perquisites were being calculated twice in gross salary calculation.
**Fix Applied**:
- **Step 1**: Calculate gross salary excluding perquisites
- **Step 2**: Calculate perquisites separately with Basic + DA
- **Step 3**: Add perquisites to gross salary
- **Step 4**: Apply exemptions to final amount

### 2.3 Added Null Check for Perquisites
**Issue**: Missing null check could cause runtime errors.
**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Initialize perquisites if not exists
if self.perquisites is None:
    self.perquisites = Perquisites()
```

## 3. TAXATION.PY FIXES

### 3.1 CRITICAL: Non-Existent Method Calls
**Issue**: Methods calling non-existent `total()` methods on income components.
**Fix Applied**:
```python
# BEFORE (Wrong)
salary_total = self.salary.total()  # total() method doesn't exist
other_sources_total = self.other_sources.total()

# AFTER (Fixed)
salary_total = self.salary.total_taxable_income_per_slab(regime=self.regime)
other_sources_total = self.other_sources.total_taxable_income_per_slab(regime=self.regime, age=self.emp_age)
```

### 3.2 CRITICAL: Missing Parameters in Method Calls
**Issue**: Income calculation methods called without required parameters.
**Fix Applied**:
- **Leave encashment**: Added regime, govt employee status, service years, salary parameters
- **Voluntary retirement**: Added regime, age, service years, salary parameters
- **House property**: Added regime parameter
- **Deductions**: Added all required parameters (salary, other sources, regime, age, etc.)

### 3.3 Added Missing Income Sources
**Issue**: Pension and gratuity income were not included in tax calculations.
**Fix Applied**:
- **Pension income**: Added computed and uncomputed pension calculations
- **Gratuity income**: Added gratuity calculation with proper parameters
- **Proper integration**: All income sources now included in gross income

### 3.4 Enhanced Error Handling
**Issue**: Methods would fail if optional components were missing.
**Fix Applied**:
- **hasattr checks**: Added proper attribute existence checks
- **Default parameters**: Provided sensible defaults for missing data
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Methods handle missing components gracefully
