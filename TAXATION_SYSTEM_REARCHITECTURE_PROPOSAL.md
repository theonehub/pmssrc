# Tax Computation System - Re-Architecture Proposal

## Executive Summary
This document outlines a comprehensive re-architecture approach for the tax computation system to reduce code complexity, enhance reusability, and implement missing critical scenarios. The proposed architecture follows SOLID principles, implements design patterns, and provides a scalable foundation for handling all tax computation scenarios.

## Current System Analysis

### Strengths
- ✅ Comprehensive tax calculation logic
- ✅ LWP integration implemented
- ✅ Multiple income sources support
- ✅ Detailed logging and error handling
- ✅ Database abstraction layer

### Pain Points
- ❌ Monolithic calculation functions (1000+ lines)
- ❌ Tight coupling between components
- ❌ Duplicate logic across services
- ❌ Missing salary change tracking
- ❌ No event-driven architecture
- ❌ Limited extensibility for new scenarios
- ❌ Complex conditional logic in single functions

        self.salary_repo = salary_repo
        self.event_publisher = event_publisher
    
    def process_salary_change(self, change: SalaryChange) -> SalaryProjection:
        """Handle mid-year salary changes with projection calculation"""
        
    def calculate_annual_projection(self, employee_id: str, tax_year: str) -> SalaryProjection:
        """Calculate projected annual salary considering all changes"""
        
    def handle_retroactive_payment(self, employee_id: str, change: SalaryChange) -> ArrearsCalculation:

        """Calculate additional tax needed for remaining months"""
```

#### C. Employee Lifecycle Service
```python
class EmployeeLifecycleService:
    def handle_new_joiner(self, employee_id: str, join_date: date, previous_employment: Optional[PreviousEmployment]) -> None:
        """Handle new employee onboarding with tax implications"""

        """Handle extended leave scenarios"""
```

### 2.3 Strategy Pattern Implementation

#### A. Tax Strategy Interface
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class TaxCalculationStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_income_tax(self, context: TaxCalculationContext) -> float:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def apply_deductions(self, context: TaxCalculationContext) -> float:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_rebates(self, context: TaxCalculationContext) -> float:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_tax_slabs(self, age: int) -> List[TaxSlab]:
        pass

class OldRegimeTaxStrategy(TaxCalculationStrategy):
    def calculate_income_tax(self, context: TaxCalculationContext) -> float:
        # Old regime specific logic
        
    def apply_deductions(self, context: TaxCalculationContext) -> float:
        # All deductions applicable
        
class NewRegimeTaxStrategy(TaxCalculationStrategy):
    def calculate_income_tax(self, context: TaxCalculationContext) -> float:
        # New regime specific logic
        
    def apply_deductions(self, context: TaxCalculationContext) -> float:
        # Limited deductions
```

#### B. Income Source Calculators
```python
class IncomeCalculatorFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def get_calculator(income_type: str) -> IncomeCalculator:
        calculators = {
            "salary": SalaryIncomeCalculator(),
            "house_property": HousePropertyCalculator(),
            "capital_gains": CapitalGainsCalculator(),
            "other_sources": OtherSourcesCalculator(),
            "business": BusinessIncomeCalculator()
        }
        return calculators.get(income_type)

class SalaryIncomeCalculator(IncomeCalculator):
    def calculate(self, context: TaxCalculationContext) -> IncomeCalculationResult:
        # Handle salary projection, LWP adjustment, allowances
        
class HousePropertyCalculator(IncomeCalculator):
    def calculate(self, context: TaxCalculationContext) -> IncomeCalculationResult:
        # Handle property income, deductions, transitions
```

### 2.4 Event-Driven Architecture

#### A. Event Publisher
```python
class TaxEventPublisher:
    def __init__(self, event_store: EventStore):
        self.event_store = event_store
        self.handlers = {}
    
    def publish(self, event: TaxEvent) -> None:
        self.event_store.save(event)
        for handler in self.handlers.get(event.event_type, []):
            handler.handle(event)
    
    def subscribe(self, event_type: str, handler: EventHandler) -> None:
        if event_type not in self.handlers:
            self.handlers[event_type] = []
        self.handlers[event_type].append(handler)
```

#### B. Event Handlers
```python
class SalaryChangeEventHandler(EventHandler):
    def handle(self, event: TaxEvent) -> None:
        # Recalculate tax projections
        # Update monthly TDS
        # Notify payroll system
        
class RegimeChangeEventHandler(EventHandler):
    def handle(self, event: TaxEvent) -> None:
        # Recalculate entire tax liability
        # Adjust all future payouts
        # Generate compliance reports
```
