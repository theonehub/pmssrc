# Phase 1: Monorepo Setup - Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Monorepo Structure Creation
- ✅ Created `pmssrc-unified/` directory
- ✅ Set up workspace structure with `apps/` and `packages/` directories
- ✅ Moved existing `backend/` to root level
- ✅ Moved existing `frontend/` to `apps/web/`
- ✅ Created placeholder for `apps/mobile/`

### 2. Root Configuration
- ✅ Created root `package.json` with workspace configuration
- ✅ Added comprehensive scripts for development, building, and testing
- ✅ Created `.gitignore` for the entire monorepo
- ✅ Created comprehensive `README.md` with setup instructions

### 3. Shared Packages Setup

#### @pmssrc/shared-types
- ✅ Created package structure with TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Defined comprehensive TypeScript interfaces based on existing backend
- ✅ Included types for:
  - Authentication (LoginRequest, AuthResponse, User)
  - Attendance (AttendanceCreateRequest, AttendanceRecord, LocationData)
  - Leaves (LeaveRequest, LeaveRecord)
  - Reimbursements (ReimbursementRequest, ReimbursementRecord)
  - Organisations (Organisation)
  - Taxation (TaxCalculationRequest, TaxCalculationResponse)
  - Common utilities (ApiResponse, PaginatedResponse, Status)

#### @pmssrc/api-client
- ✅ Created unified API client for all platforms
- ✅ Mapped to all existing FastAPI endpoints from backend
- ✅ Implemented environment-aware base URL configuration
- ✅ Added comprehensive HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- ✅ Included token management and authentication
- ✅ Added support for file downloads (Blob responses)
- ✅ Implemented error handling and response parsing

#### @pmssrc/business-logic
- ✅ Created shared business logic utilities
- ✅ Implemented calculation classes:
  - `AttendanceCalculator`: Working hours, overtime, late detection
  - `LeaveCalculator`: Leave balance, duration, overlap detection
  - `ReimbursementCalculator`: Total amounts, pending calculations
  - `TaxCalculator`: Tax calculations, deductions, effective rates
  - `LocationValidator`: Geofencing, distance calculations, accuracy validation
  - `DateUtils`: Working days, date formatting, financial year
  - `ValidationUtils`: Email, phone, required fields validation

## 📁 Final Structure

```
pmssrc-unified/
├── backend/                    # ✅ Existing FastAPI backend
├── apps/
│   ├── web/                   # ✅ Existing React app (moved)
│   └── mobile/                # 🔄 Ready for Phase 2
└── packages/
    ├── shared-types/          # ✅ Complete with TypeScript types
    ├── api-client/           # ✅ Complete with API client
    └── business-logic/       # ✅ Complete with business utilities
```

## 🔧 Configuration Files Created

1. **Root Configuration**
   - `package.json` - Monorepo workspace configuration
   - `.gitignore` - Comprehensive ignore patterns
   - `README.md` - Complete setup and usage documentation

2. **Shared Types Package**
   - `packages/shared-types/package.json`
   - `packages/shared-types/tsconfig.json`
   - `packages/shared-types/src/index.ts`

3. **API Client Package**
   - `packages/api-client/package.json`
   - `packages/api-client/tsconfig.json`
   - `packages/api-client/src/index.ts`

4. **Business Logic Package**
   - `packages/business-logic/package.json`
   - `packages/business-logic/tsconfig.json`
   - `packages/business-logic/src/index.ts`

## 🎯 Key Achievements

### 1. **Unified API Client**
- Single API client that works across web and mobile
- Automatic environment detection (web vs React Native)
- Comprehensive endpoint mapping to existing FastAPI routes
- Proper error handling and response parsing

### 2. **Shared Type Safety**
- TypeScript interfaces that match existing backend structure
- Consistent types across all applications
- Comprehensive type coverage for all business entities

### 3. **Reusable Business Logic**
- Calculation utilities that can be shared between platforms
- Location validation and geofencing support
- Tax calculation and attendance analysis
- Date utilities and validation helpers

### 4. **Development Workflow**
- Monorepo scripts for easy development
- Workspace configuration for dependency management
- Comprehensive documentation and setup instructions

## 🚀 Ready for Phase 2

The monorepo is now ready for Phase 2: Mobile App Foundation. The structure provides:

1. **Clear separation** between backend, web, and mobile
2. **Shared packages** for code reuse and consistency
3. **Type safety** across all platforms
4. **Unified API client** for seamless backend integration
5. **Business logic utilities** for consistent calculations

## 📋 Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **Initialize Expo project** in `apps/mobile/`
2. **Set up authentication** with JWT + Biometric support
3. **Create basic navigation** structure
4. **Integrate shared packages** into mobile app
5. **Implement location services** for attendance tracking

## 🔍 Verification

To verify the setup:

```bash
# Check structure
ls -la pmssrc-unified/

# Verify packages
cd pmssrc-unified/packages/shared-types && npm run build
cd ../api-client && npm run build
cd ../business-logic && npm run build

# Check workspace configuration
cd ../../ && npm run install:all
```

The monorepo is now properly structured and ready for the next phase of development!
